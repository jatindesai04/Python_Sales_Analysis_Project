 # Retail Sales Data Analysis (Python) 				

Description: In this project, I constructed a comprehensive data pipeline to analyze retail sales data. The project involved several key stages:

Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Loaded the raw retail sales dataset from a CSV file. Conducted basic data exploration to understand the structure and contents of the dataset. Performed data cleaning tasks, such as checking for missing values and removing duplicate rows. Data Transformation and Feature Engineering:
Transformed the data by creating new features, such as calculating total price and extracting month and weekday information from the invoice date. Engineered additional features to enhance the dataset for analysis purposes. 
Database Integration:
Established a connection to a MySQL database and created an engine for data insertion. Loaded the transformed dataset into the MySQL database for further analysis and storage. 
Analysis and Visualization:
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) by computing summary statistics for numerical columns. Visualized sales trends by plotting the highest sales on a month-wise basis.

This project showcases the end-to-end process of data exploration, cleaning, transformation, database integration, and analysis, providing valuable insights into retail sales trends and performance.
